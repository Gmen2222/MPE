                <h2>Comprehensive Production Capabilities</h2>
                <p>When more is wanted from us, we are always ready, willing and extremely able!
Our pre-production capabilities include: Conceptualization and ideation, storyline development, scriptwriting, casting, studio and location management, art direction,  production design, wardrobe, props, and set construction, and complete production coordination.</p>

                <p>In terms of Field and Studio capabilities, MPE has always provided production quality that is world class.  Our knowledge and experience in this area is unparalleled, and our body of work speaks for itself.</p>

                <h2>If You Want To Get Technical About It!</h2>
                <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment owns an extensive inventory of state of the art camera, lighting, and sound packages for field acquisition, and has full fledged post production capabilities.</p>
                <p>In this regard MPE  is uniquely positioned as a signatory production company for IATSE, IBEW and the Directors Guild of America.   </p>
                <p>We are proficient with all of the latest digital cameras including the ARRI Alexa, RED Epic (soon to be Dragon), SONY F55/F5, Canon C500/300, and all 2/3rd’s HD format cameras such as the Panasonic Varicam and Sony F-700/800 XDCam cameras, and their related post production work-flows.</p>
                <p>We offer Final-Cut Pro and Avid editing in-house, as well as Adobe After Effects, Davinci Resolve, and Pro-Tools work stations.</p>
                <p>OK. Yes!  We own state of the art camera, lighting, sound, and post-production facilities... but these days a lot of people can make that claim.</p>
                <p>We believe it’s much more about the people behind the facilities. They are the ones who truly make the difference.</p>
                <p>In our early days we used to joke:  It’s not the camera, man!  It’s the cameraman!  We used to laugh about that, but that statement was true then, and it is <i>still</i> true today. And it applies to all facets of content creation.</p>
            </article>

                <p>In this regard MPE  is uniquely positioned as a signatory production company for IATSE, IBEW and the Directors Guild of America.</p>
                <p>Our current agreements also provide us with the flexibility of producing content that is non-union affiliated as well.</p>
