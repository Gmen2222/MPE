Manhattan Place Entertainment gets "Back On Track"!
 
April 19, 2012
 
    <p>Manhattan place entertainment (MPE) recently got "Back on Track" with SPEED to execute a major production shoot this time involving the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p> 
    <p>Working on location in Mooresville, NC, MPE handled all aspects of the field production.</p>
    <p>Through careful planning and proper execution, we were able to successfully acquire a wide variety of visual elements, that in-turn, will be implemented in a multitude of ways into SPEED's season long coverage of the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
    <p>"The first step for us was designing and building a set that created an edgy and moody environment for the Truck Series drivers to appear in .  Once that was achieved, it was like "shooting fish in a barrel" said Steve Cohen.  "All that was left after that was for the drivers to come in and follow our lead so we could get cool shots of them on the set"  The set acted as the focal point for the two days of shooting with the 34 different drivers, but also served as the main environment for photographing various specialty shots including racing props, signage, and other SPEED branded elements for the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
    <p>Steve Cohen Executive Produced for MPE and acted as Director and Director of Photography on-site, leading a team of talented production designers, producers, camera and lighting technicians and other production support teams. </p>

</p>
<p>We have worked extensively with  on-air promotions and marketing departments and recently did an award winning campaign for The New York Knicks (who, at last check still fall under the category of professional sports!).</p>

<p>We've always remained at the forefront of emerging technologies and as far back as 2004 acted as special consultants to Pace Films in implementing their 3D realitycam system into sports television for the first time! (The very same 3D system that was used on "Avatar", "Hannah Montana - Best of Both Worlds",  and is currently being used at ESPN 3D).</p>

<p>As production facilitators, we take as much or as little off your plate as you want, and use the strength of our roster and vast resources to provide our clients with a hand-picked "dream team"  of specialists to handle their specific project needs.</p>

<p>Translation:  We know how to get things done at an extremely high level but without the extremely high price tags!!
</p>
<p>We are confident that we can become a uniquely effective strategic alliance and trusted production partner, and in this day and age, that could only be a good thing.
