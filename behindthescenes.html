            <h1><a name="before" class="anchor">Before and After</a></h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>At the conclusion of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game Tuesday night, Joe Buck informed a national television audience that his Hall of Fame broadcasting partner Tim McCarver had just concluded his 15th and final All-Star Game telecast for FOX Sports.</p>
            <p>McCarver prepared a retrospective piece about his personal All-Star game recollections, drawing from memories of his childhood, his playing days,  and his years as a broadcaster... a metaphorical  "before and after" of his magnificent career.</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was proud to be selected by FOX Sports to shoot this retrospective.  Bernie Kim produced, and the piece was shot on location with Tim McCarver in New York City two days before the game.</p>
            <p>Below is our version of the production "before and after".</p>
            <p>BEFORE</p>
            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/before.jpg" alt="Before and After"  />
            <p>A small hotel room in NYC was transformed into a baseball environment that gave Mr. McCarver the appropriate setting and platform to reflect... and share.</p>
            <p style="float:left;width:100%;">AFTER</p>
            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/after.jpg" alt="Before and After"  />

            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/midnight.jpg" alt="Midnight Moment in Times Square"  />
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment had the honor of being selected by the Times Square Alliance to produce a feature piece documenting "The Power of Words" -- a short film that appeared on the Times Square screens last month.</p>
            <p>"The Power of Words" was created in tribute to Nelson Mandela and incorporated text taken from the South African leaders most inspirational writings in an artful display that was synchronized on screens across Times Square.</p>
            <p>"It was an amazing experience witnessing this powerful art piece in the heart of Times Square,"said Steve Cohen who directed for Manhattan Place. "And it was truly an honor and a privilege to meet and interview Mr. Mandela's Grandsons".</p>
            <p>"Midnight Moment: A Digital Gallery" is the largest coordinated effort in history by the sign operators in Times Square to display synchronized, cutting-edge creative content at the same time every day.  Each month, the program presents a new selection to be screened with scheduled appearances every day at exactly 11:57pm. The piece plays for 3 minutes and magically concludes at the moment of midnight.</p>
            <p>Alas, The Midnight Moment.</p>

            <p>When World Wrestling Entertainment needs to think out of the box, they call Manhattan Place Entertainment- and this time was no different!
        If you have young ones in school, you know that most every classroom these days has an electronic "smartboard" in place of the old chalk and slate some of us are  more familiar with!</p>
            <p>But the folks at WWE needed to go retro for their Extreme Rules promo spot, and they knew exactly who to call!
        Among the most resourceful production companies you'll find, not only can MPE shoot , direct, produce and post produce your content, but they will find the perfect location to shoot in as well!</p>
            <p>In this case the MPE detectives uncovered Assumption school in Fairfield CT, still rocking erasers and the like, lending itself as the perfect setting for a flashback of WWE superstar Sheamus serving detention as"youthful schoolboy".  In the spot, young Sheamus is seen repeatedly writing the phrase "I will not be extreme" on the blackboard, building toward the climax of the spot (you have to watch to see what happens).  The end product was exactly what the WWE folks had in mind-
        The finished spot premiered during Wrestlemania on April 7th.</p>
            <p>So remember,  whether you're in the market for  "Cutting Edge " or your literally looking to go "Old School"   -
        Manhattan Place will "go to the extreme" for you as well.</p>

            <p>For the second year in a row, Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) had the good fortune of collaborating with The New York Racing Association on commercial spots for the Belmont Stakes. The :30 second and :15 second spots entitled "The Test of the Champion",  specifically focused on the 3rd jewel of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.</p>
            <p>New York's Belmont Park is the sight of this annual event and the commercials showcase the history, beauty and grandeur of the hallowed venue along with the excitement and thundering action that is witnessed during one of sports greatest spectacles.</p>
            <p>Donald Nelson from the NYRA said, "Just like the first time we worked with them, Manhattan Place did an outstanding job.  They not only beat deadlines but provided great creative direction and an exceptional end product that captured the excitement and enthusiasm of our signature event."</p>
            <p>"What people might not know is that we were also prepared to cut an entirely different spot based on the outcome of the Preakness Stakes", said MPE's President and Executive Producer Steve Cohen.</p> 
            <p>"If there was a horse making a bid for the Triple Crown at Belmont, we would've created a spot specifically with that storyline in mind.   But when Oxbow won the Preakness Stakes, and it was determined there would be no Triple Crown winner this year, we stayed in the direction of "The Test of The Champion" spots."</p>
            <p>"But then again,  that's why we love working in sports production, it's unpredictable, which keeps things interesting".</p>
            <p>The spots aired on NBC Sports.</p>

            <img class="float_right" src="images/recent-work/gus-johnson.jpg" alt="Gus Johnson handles FOX Soccer duties"  />
            <p>Last week an old friend stopped by the Manhattan Place Entertainment studio to do a green screen shoot for Fox-
Gus Johnson!</p>
            <p>As you may know, Gus was recently assigned to the prestigious role of play by play man for Fox.</p>
            <p>Gus will be behind the mics for games in the  Barclays Premier League, the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League matches, including the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League Finals, May 11 and 25, respectively, on FOX.</p>
            <p>It was a bit of a homecoming for Johnson since MPE Co-chairman Mike McCarthy helped him get his start at MSG Network as the radio voice of the Knicks, and Founder Steve Cohen had worked with Gus many times over the years as Johnson's career developed at MSG and CBS.</p>
            <p>"Manhattan Place is a first rate operation", Johnson said. It doesn't surprise that they get the work that they do-they're top notch."</p>
            <p>"When we hired Gus at MSG, we knew we were, at a minimum, getting a high energy package-what we couldn't know at the start was how he would go over -and how many folks would want to see and hear more of him-I couldn't be happier for him", McCarthy said.</p>
            <p>"The job of play by play for what is clearly the highest level of soccer is a demanding role with many levels of scrutiny, on an international level", McCarthy said-"You have to have talent, work ethic, and perhaps most importantly a thick skin-and Gus has all of those."</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment serves all your video needs, from field production to post production and everything in between, whether you're a commercial producer or a play by play man on your way to Barcelona, give us a call!</p>

            <p>MPE has added industry veteran Joe Favorito as a Public Relations consultant to better serve our clients from a communications standpoint, and to better tell our story to the media and to all those who will be interested in hearing all we have done, and all we plan to do.</p>
            <p>Joe has spent his career helping manage the communications, business development and brand strategy for some of the biggest companies in sports and entertainment, from the NBA's Knicks and 76ers to the USTA and Bloomberg Sports.  He has had a hand in promoting everything from Broadway plays and hit movies to startups in Mixed Martial Arts and the Olympics, and now he is helping mold Manhattan Place's strategy as a consultant in many areas.  Ranging from content to communications and social media. "I have known and respected the work that Steve (Cohen, founder) and Mike (McCarthy, co- Chairman) have done for years and it is a pleasure to help tell their story and grow their vision," said Favorito, who now runs his own independent consulting business and is also an author and professor at Columbia University. "The work they have done in their respective areas over decades is always visionary and best in class, and it is exciting to be able to assist them in what they have coming next."</p>
            <p>"We are really excited to have an industry leader and an 'insider's insider' like Joe on our team," Mike McCarthy added. "He has always been one of the most respected communications professionals in the business, and can help us and our clients maximize all the strong work we are doing.  It's another asset that we can offer up to our clients as our business continues to grow."</p>

            <p>After an exciting year at Manhattan Place Entertainment, we thought we'd stop for a second, catch our breath (in New York we can actually see our breath) and reflect on the work we've done and the clients, new and old, we've provided services for.</p>
            <p>Of course, being in the moving video business, the best way for us to reflect on our work is to watch it - all of it - select the best examples of that work and put them together using the finest production tools available in a form that people, anywhere and anytime, can watch.</p>
            <p>The result? A highlight or "sizzle" reel. Our chosen path of distribution? The World Wide Web.</p>

            <p>With the exception of the 3.5 million dollar Super Bowl commercials these days, most of the time, we miss them ---- commercials, that is ---- we DVR, TiVo or Netflix our way right past them.  The solution for a brand to get its message across? Product placement!</p>
            <p>In a way, we've come full circle - in the old days Art Linkletter, Gary Moore and even Johnny Carson would hold up a product right within the body of the show and begin pitching-Product placement in its most basic form.</p>
            <p>In this, the "DVR" era, Product placement has become infinitely crucial to branding efforts - "Modern Family" does it, "Skyfall" does it, almost all forms of reality programming do it - and more and more of them, including some on that list, call on Manhattan Place Entertainment to execute the vision.</p>
            <p>One such recent  example was with Ford and its superior utility vehicle, the "Escape".</p>
            <a href="../digital/escape-to-nyc/video.html"><img class="float_left" src="_img/recent-work/glam-ford-02.jpg" alt="Glam-Ford Escape"  /></a>
            <p>Ford reached out to Glam.com to consider exposure within its popular webisodes with Lauren Messiah, an L.A. based stylist and fashion blogger.</p>
            <p>Seamless integration of the "Escape" was employed with MPE's unique field production and post production skills to create a viewing experience that was informative to watch and equally effective for Ford's messaging - a double win for the viewer and the client, always MPE's ultimate goal.</p>
            <p>Working with Manhattan Place is always a joy, said Robert McConnell, the Director of Ad Solutions for Glam.com. The team is dedicated to turning out an excellent end product, making the planning and shooting process easy and seamless, and lastly providing excellent value."</p>
            <p>Worried about folks skipping your commercial? Ford had the same concerns until they used Product placement with Manhattan Place Entertainment-Let us do the same for you!</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment, through its long standing partnership with <a href="http://www.glam.com">Glam.com</a>, produced a series of vignettes showcasing Fall and Winter fashion for women earlier this season.</p>

            <p>This week MPE did a pro bono shoot for Prostate Cancer Awareness at the School of Visual Arts -- the event featured an appearance by a fairly well known relief pitcher -- Mariano Rivera.</p>
            <p>Rivera, in most eyes the greatest stopper in the history of the game, made the news with his statements regarding last years post season --"It was torture", Rivera said.  "At one time I was home and I said I have to go there and throw, I was calling the office and they said, "Well you cannot do that, you're not ready."</p>
            <p>Rivera was introduced while his entrance song "Enter Sandman" played in the background as it has for the fifteen years he has pitched for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He was inevitably asked about his health (he was out last year with a torn ACL he incurred while shagging flies) and said  "I have my pitching coach here so I can't lie", Rivera said. I feel great, I feel real good."</p>
            <p>Rivera was joined by the aforementioned pitching coach Larry Rothschild, former catcher John Flaherty and former Yankee great David Cone.</p>
            <p>The  event was held to raise funds and awareness for Prostate Cancer.</p>

            <p>Recently, Manhattan Place Entertainment was honored to have been chosen as the field production solution for a charity called "Donors Choose", a group that does wonderful things for folks in need on a nationwide basis and more importantly right here in our neighborhood- the South Bronx.</p>
            <p>At MS 223, teacher Bill Ohl spearheads the effort to solve a simple yet critical need for his students-the need for books.</p>
            <p>"The South Bronx is Ground Zero for childhood poverty", Ohl said. "There are 500,000 residents in the South Bronx, and not a single bookstore to be found -"Donors Choose" allows us to put good books into the hands of kids on a regular basis. 
</p>
            <p>MPE provided the field production as part of a collaboration with the lead production team from "Anatomy" - the video is shown <a href="https://vimeo.com/57555383">here</a></p>
            <p>The video was shown at a fund raising event earlier this month called the "100 Women in Hedge Funds' Gala" and helped raise over 1.4 million dollars for "Donors Choose".</p>
            <p>It is our hope that MPE's friends and clients review the link below and consider a donation to "Donor's Choose" - it is a remarkable effort endorsed by folks such as Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert, who says on the website "You know exactly who you're helping".</p>
            <p>The website presents real teachers, like  Bill Ohl, expressing real needs for real students.</p>

            <p>And now that those boring negotiations are over, MPE is hitting the ice by shooting promotional material for the New York Rangers this weekend and will be rolling out more hockey products in the coming weeks to help celebrate the dropping of the puck!</p>

            <p>McCarthy, who recently left a CEO job with the St Louis Blues to reestablish NY TV roots, feels Manhattan Place Entertainment is uniquely poised to bring NHL related content to bear.</p>
            <p>"We've got some strong relationships and no shortage of concepts for folks in the hockey world to reconnect with their fan bases, from long form programming to promotional spots, and everything in between -- stay tuned!"</p>
            <p>The MPE cams were also busy last week helping long time partner WWE launch a new character with an interesting shoot in the Edison Ballroom (hint hint) and will be hitting the West Coast to produce spots for Glam and Nature Maid next week.</p>

            <p class="date">December 12, 2012</p><hr/>
            <img class="float_left" src="_img/talent-michael-mccarthy.jpg" alt="Mike McCarthy"  />
            <p>Former CEO of the NHL's St. Louis Blues and Long Time Head of Madison Square Garden Networks To Fill New Role With One Of The Broadcast  Industry's Leading  Production Entities</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment, one of the nation's leading production and creative services companies, today announced that they have named Mike McCarthy to the newly created position of Co-Chairman. McCarthy, one of the most respected and innovative executives in the entertainment business, joins Manhattan Place after a storied career in business management and broadcast production, most recently as Chief Executive Officer of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League after a trailblazing run with Madison Square Garden Networks. McCarthy will help oversee new business development and brand project growth for Manhattan Place, whose 25 year track record in advertising campaigns, episodic series, branded content, commercials, and on-air promotions for broadcast, the web, or digital platforms, is among the best in the industry.</p>
            <p>"Mike McCarthy brings the exact skill set that will change the game for MPE and all of our partners. His vision and leadership will enable us to broaden the overall scope of what we do and take it to an entirely new level," said Manhattan Place Founder/President Steve Cohen. "We are beyond excited by the prospects of being able to take a concept, make it, and distribute it. If we were a sports franchise, I'd feel like we just signed the most coveted free agent on the market by adding Mike to the organization. We got our lead-off man, cleanup hitter, number 1 starting pitcher and lights out closer all rolled into one!  We're on an emotional high right now because we feel like the skies the limit in terms of where we can go from here."</p>
            <p>"I have seen the exemplary work that Steve and the team have done over the years, and I am looking forward to working with them to further expand their reach for both new and existing clients," McCarthy said. "The entertainment business these days is being driven by creative minds that know how to tell brand stories in every visual means possible, and no one has done that better than Manhattan Place.  It will be exciting to help not just grow the business but the footprint of the industry together as well. The current content landscape is blurred between agencies, production 
companies and distribution outlets-this talented group at MPE is poised to take advantage of this unique opportunity and I'm proud to be a part of it."</p>
            <p>A Connecticut resident, McCarthy most recently served as the CEO and Alternate Governor of the St. Louis Blues, where he oversaw day-to-day operations for the NHL franchise, guiding the team to its first Central Division title in over 10 years, and driving revenue growth to unprecedented heights for the club. He was also directly responsible for operating the Scottrade Center, the 7th most active arena in the United States, and the re-opened  and renovated Peabody Opera House. As a founding partner of SCP Worldwide, he was chairman of the highly acclaimed sports, entertainment and media production company, Tupelo Honey Productions, driving significant revenue growth and client base for the firm.</p>
            <p>Prior to joining SCP Worldwide, McCarthy served as President of Madison Square Garden Networks Group, a position he rose to during his 23-year career with the organization. During his tenure, he oversaw  production, programming,  ad sales, marketing, new media, technical operations and affiliate sales efforts that led to an extraordinary 50 Emmy Awards and 250 Emmy Award Nominations as well as a host of other accolades that included the national Cable ACE Award, an International Festival Award, two Pro Max Marketing Awards, a Bandies Award and The Mark Award. Besides being recognized for excellence in traditional television production and programming, McCarthy initiated a series of innovations that helped make MSG one of the most technically advanced regional networks. Those innovations included the introduction of High Definition Television (HDTV) in 1998 when MSG aired the first regularly scheduled sports events covered in HD.</p>
            <p>As the leader of Madison Square Garden Networks Group, Mr. McCarthy had the responsibility of overseeing the entire operation of MSG Network, Fox Sports Net New York, MSG Radio, MSG ITV and MSGNetwork.com. He managed budgets of  almost $400 million in revenue and over $200 million in expenses, while overseeing over 200 staff and another 300 freelance employees.

            <p>As most everyone knows by now, The Rolling Stones are playing a handful of concert dates to celebrate 50 years of the band being together.   What you may not realize is that the Stones would not have been able to recover their costs for this mini-tour unless they got "fiscally" creative.</p>
            <p>"Usually, when you do 100 shows or 130 shows, you kind of start to break even around 30." said Mick Jagger.  "If you only do 7 shows you're never going to break even."</p>
            <p>So, the idea of a doing a live pay per view concert was put into motion!  And with that in mind, a strong pay-per-view partner was needed. Enter WWE. WWE, the world's pre-eminent provider of pay-per-view programming, in partnership with the Dainty Group and Endemol (the tour's promoters), will be distributing and marketing the pay-per-view event entitled "One More Shot".</p>
            <p></p>
            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/stones2.jpg" alt="WWE and MPE collaborate on Rolling Stones promotional shoot!"  />
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment had the great fortune of being asked by WWE to shoot a variety of material with members of the band to help promote the upcoming live pay per view.</p>
            <p>"I'm not going to lie, this was one of those times where I would have paid to be on this shoot."  said Steve Cohen who was the director of photography for Manhattan Place Entertainment.   "It was a once in a lifetime experience, and one I will never forget".  (Too bad Keith was home sick!)</p>
            <p>The live pay per view event entitled "One More Shot" is this Saturday, December 15th at 9pm.</p>

            <p>We never imagined that the WWE would ask us to be their dance partner... but we were wrong!</p>
            <p>Since it takes (2) to Tango, the WWE once again "turned" (yes, another dance pun) to Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) to shoot another in its series of character vignettes.</p>
            <p>The latest spot features Fandango, a new Superstar who is a "smooth" operator both in the ring and on the ballroom dance floor!</p>
            <p>To get this project accomplished, MPE had to perform some quick "steps" of our own to meet the challenges involved, one of which was finding an available location that visually conveyed the look and feel of a network "Ballroom Dance Show" in less than 24 hours.</p>
            <p>We came up with several options and the choice was made to shoot at Manhattan's elegant Highline Ballroom.</p>
            <p>With Steve Cohen as Director of Photography, MPE handled all of  the production management providing such production services as camera department, lighting, grip, sound, make-up, wardrobe, casting, locations, and all of the manpower for the project. It all resulted in a piece that visually had a cinematic quality along with all of the glitz, glamour, and characteristic style of a TV dancing show.</p>
            <p>With our quick and efficient work against a tight deadline, we once again proved that as a production company we can deliver at a high level, regardless of circumstance.  You might say this was a case where we were happy to "do the hustle" for our client.</p>
            <p>The spot aired November 12th as part of the USA Network's Monday Night Raw series.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment saddles up once again with the New York Racing Association as part of an ongoing campaign to promote thoroughbred racing in the state of New York.</p>
            <p>The NYRA turned to MPE to produce a spot that highlights the importance of horse racing and breeding to the state's overall economy.</p>
            <p>The campaign illustrates how New York's more than 300 breeding farms, employing about 35,000 workers, make up a vital part of the state's economy.</p>
            <p>The spot combines exciting racing highlights from Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, along with poignant imagery from New York's breeding farms.</p>
            <p>This spot crosses the finish line by emphasizing the central theme of the campaign, utilizing the branded slogan created by MPE for NYRA "The Racing Heart of New York."</p>
            <p>The campaign premiered during NBC'sports coverage of the 2012 Belmont Stakes and will continue to run throughout the year.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment has continued to tag team with World Wrestling Federation, which has turned to MPE to shoot a series of vignettes.</p>
            <p>The segments are airing as part of WWE's '"Monday Night Raw" television show on the USA Network.</p>
            <p>And in the latest installment, the partnership "rages" on, as we catch up with two WWE Superstars who are ordered to undergo anger management counseling.</p>
            <p>With Steve Cohen as the Director of Photography, MPE's cameras shot three different vignettes featuring Daniel Bryan and Kane.</p>
            <p>A pseudo-psychologist named Dr. Shelby tries to help them work through their anger issues, as the two Superstars examine the roots of their rage.</p>
            <p>Can these two share the ring without driving each other crazy?
WWE fans will soon learn the answers, as the vignettes helped set the stage for another big night for the WWE Universe.</p>
            <p>The videos can also be seen on the WWE's web site, and hopefully you'll have as much fun watching them as we did shooting them.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment is taking a trip uptown to a mysterious new 'haunt' on the Upper East Side.</p>  
            <p>It's "666 Park Avenue", a new show on ABC this fall, about an apartment building called 'The Drake" that might be possessed by supernatural forces.</p>
            <p>MPE was called upon to shoot behind the scenes footage and content about the show, which premieres Sunday, September 30th.
Taking our cameras on location to the scene of the series, we shot an interview with one of the stars, acclaimed singer and actress Vanessa Williams.</p>
            <p>She discusses her role on the show as Olivia Doran, the wife of the owner and landlord of the building.</p>
            <p>We also interviewed the show's costume designer for some insight into the cast's wardrobe, and shot footage of the show while it was in production, including the cast shooting their scenes, the costume area, and the crew at work.</p>
            <p>The footage will be used to promote the new series and give viewers an inside look at the people behind it.</p>
            <p>So look for MPE's work on the show's <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/666-park-avenue">web site</a>, and be sure and drop in at New York's most thrilling and chilling address: '666 Park Avenue', Sunday nights at 10 on ABC.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment steps into the ring with World Wrestling Entertainment, collaborating on a special feature for WWE's "Monday Night Raw".</p>  
            <p>Recently we headed to WWE headquarters in Stamford Connecticut, to shoot a humorous vignette promoting a match between two WWE superstars: David Otunga and World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus.</p>
            <p>The premise of the skit is a mock deposition, in which Otunga plays an attorney trying to ban Sheamus's most devastating weapon: the Brogue Kick, after he kicked Otunga's "client", fellow wrestler Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
            <p>Seamus is forced to defend himself and he immediately sets the tone.  
When asked if he "solemnly swears", he starts swearing at his opponent, only to be told it's not that kind of swearing.</p>
            <p>Things continue to get more heated, until Sheamus brings the deposition to a crashing halt, by delivering one of his brogue kicks right into the camera.</p>
            <p>Luckily we still have a few cameras left.</p>
            <p>It all makes for an entertaining video, which aired September 10th as part of the buildup to the match between two of the WWE's top wrestlers.</p>
            <p>You can still catch it online on the WWE's web site, and we're sure you'll get a "kick" out of it.</p>

            <p>With the 2012 U.S. Open in full "swing", Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) is teaming up with the Tennis Channel on its coverage of the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.</p>  
            <p>MPE has been called upon to collaborate on a U.S. Open show called "Tennis Channel Academy" hosted by a tennis Hall of Famer Tracy Austin.</p>
            <p>MPE's cameras captured in-depth interviews with some of the biggest stars in tennis, including three-time U.S. Open champion Serena Williams, five-time champ Roger Federer, Olympic gold medalist Andy Murray and career Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova.</p>
            <p>We also shot a feature on one of the most accomplished and inspirational players in tennis history, the late Arthur Ashe.</p>
            <p>Along with the player profiles, Manhattan Place is providing the visuals to establish much of the show's look, shooting branding scenics from around New York City, behind the scenes footage of the broadcast, on court action and the championship trophy itself.</p>
            <p>Tune in to The Tennis Channel throughout the rest of the USOpen tournament and you'll see some of MPE's best stuff "served" up.</p>

            </a>
            <p>One of television's most respected journalists, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, will launch Season 2 of his daytime talk show this fall, "Anderson Live". Working in collaboration with Definition 6 and Joe Chapura's Danieli Entertainment, Steve Cohen was the Director for four spots focusing on the extensive preparation underway for this year's revamped edition of "Anderson Live".</p>  
            <p>The show will be moving to a new set at Manhattan's CBS Broadcast Center, and will have a live studio audience along with a rotating set of guest co-hosts.  The spots were shot in the various locations that were a "work" in progress, including the studio that the show will go live from, the administrative offices, and the set construction department.</p>
            <p>Shooting Anderson in these environments helped to convey the anticipation, excitement and energy surrounding the new show as it comes together. "This was a wonderful experience for me.  Working with Joe Chapura and Rich Krekian and the folks from Definition 6 on this project was a total pleasure," said Steve. "And Anderson is a real pro. As a director, I appreciate his instincts for knowing how to deliver on a project like this. He made me look good in the process."</p>
            <p>Look for the promos for the show over the coming weeks, and speaking of promos, we also want to "direct" your attention to the new season of "Anderson Live," premiering Monday, September 10th at 12 noon on Fox 5 in New York.</p>

            <p>The New York Racing Association (NYRA) was not "horsing" around when they retained Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) to produce their latest series of branded video content. The campaign included multiple commercial spots and a long form video for the web.</p>  
            <p>The objective was to show the excitement, grandeur and history of thoroughbred racing in the state of New York, while enticing fans to visit the state's three most fabled venues for "The Sport of Kings": Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga race tracks.</p>
            <p>The campaign also highlights the importance of the thoroughbred racing industry to the overall economy of New York State.</p>
            <p>"Our company needed two signature commercial spots and MPE delivered beyond all expectations." said Dan Silver NYRA's Director of Communications & Media Relations.  "The final product was of the highest quality.  Their professionalism and talent was evident in every step of the creative process."</p>
            <p>MPE created the new brand slogan, "The Racing Heart of New York"for the campaign and animated the NYRA logo to simulate a pumping heart beat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Silver added, "It was a pleasure to work with MPE. We would highly recommend them to anyone in search of a supremely talented and easy to deal with production team."</p>
            <p>The campaign premiered during NBC Sports' coverage of the 2012 Belmont Stakes.</p>
            <p>MPE is proud to have helped NYRA bring this winner across the finish line.</p>

            </a>
            <p>By now, you've probably seen or heard the "DO EVERYTHING. DO ANYTHING.  DO AC." campaign, inviting visitors to come to Atlantic City.</p>  
            <p>What you may not have known is that Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) has been "Do-ing" its part on the video production side of the campaign.</p>
            <p>Euro RSCG Worldwide, the ad agency behind "DO EVERYTHING.  DO ANYTHING.  DO AC", along with the Atlantic City Alliance were faced with the task of capturing spectacular images of the special events that took place on the Atlantic City beach and boardwalk this past 4th of July. With an extremely high "visual" standard in mind, they once again turned to MPE.</p>
            <p>"Working with Steve Cohen and the crew at Manhattan Place Entertainment was a fantastic experience!" said Euro RSCG producer Lisa Christman.  "The footage looks amazing and both the agency and AC clients are thrilled with the final video."
</p>
            <p>"It was a pretty cool gig" said Steve Cohen of Manhattan Place Entertainment. "The main challenge was coming up with a plan that enabled us to be in multiple locations  "simultaneously" so that we wouldn't miss anything that was going on that day.  Having 6 camera crews helped!.  I think we got some very pretty looking images and I'm really proud of the way the video turned out".</p>
            <p>The day's events featured a free concert with recording star Kevin Rudolf, who performed his hit "Let It Rock", which is the theme song of the "DO EVERYTHING. DO ANYTHING. DO AC." campaign.</p>
            <p>The skies above the city also lit up with a fantastic fireworks display by the famed Grucci brothers, billed as the largest display in New Jersey.
After the sights and sounds of the music and fireworks, the night was topped off by the premiere of the dazzling "Duality" 3D light show.</p>
            <p>Visitors to Atlantic City can now experience the light show every night year round at the city's historic Boardwalk Hall. It leaves crowds in amazement, as the facade of the Hall seems to shatter and fall, only to magically reappear minutes later.</p>

            <p>Jamie Cohen, Manhattan Place Entertainment's resident still photographer, added this very "tasteful" image to her portfolio on a recent tabletop shoot for Tofutti Brands.</p>  
            <p>Best-known for dairy-free ice cream, Tofutti has created their first dairy-free ricotta product available directly to consumers, called "Dairy Free Ravioli".</p>
            <p>Tofutti turned to Jamie to get this project covered and they meant it... literally!</p>
            <p>So from now on, whenever you are in the frozen foods section by the Tofutti, you'll see Jamie Cohen's photography on every cover of Tofutti's Dairy Free Ravioli packages.</p>
            <p>As you can guess, this was one shoot where the photographer DID NOT have to instruct the subject to "say cheese" when she snapped the photo.</p>

            <p>An international sporting event - at the Crossroads of the World, Times Square. And Manhattan Place Entertainment is there to bring it all to viewers, on the scene and on TV.</p>  
            <p>Global Media turned to MPE to bring its production expertise to 'The Grapple in the Apple", an Olympic qualifying wrestling match between the USA and Russia.</p>
            <p>The match was hosted by Beat The Streets, a non-profit organization that promotes the sport of amateur wrestling.</p>
            <p>It was the latest example of MPE using its complete production capabilities to successfully execute a project.  With Steve Cohen as Director, we set up an elaborate four-camera shoot, and handled all aspects of the live production on the technical end.</p>
            <p>The match was shown live on the Times Square Jumbotron in front of an estimated crowd of 20,000, and televised two weeks later on the NBC Sports Network.</p>
            <p>In the end, the United States thrilled the crowd with a 4-3 victory over the Russians, and Coleman Scott earned the final spot on the U.S. men's freestyle team for the London Olympics in August.</p>
            <p>But one of the biggest winners was Beat The Streets, as the event raised $1.4 million to help the organization expand and develop wrestling programs in the New York area.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment adds to its growing list of industry honors, with a 2012 Telly Award for its pregame introduction for the New York Knicks.</p>  
            <p>MPE was recognized with the Telly Awards' highest honor: a Silver, in the category of Best Sports Segments and Best Promotional Piece in Sports.</p>
            <p>We teamed up with the Knicks on the open that was played on the Madison Square Garden video screen before every home game at MSG.</p>
            <p>For this project, we shot specialized images of the Knicks players, headlined by their three stars; Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler.</p>
            <p>But the production was not without its share of challenges.</p>
            <p>Working with a professional sports franchise often dictates where, when and how a shoot can be carried out. And in this case, the only space available that would meet our needs and the productions design was the Zamboni garage used by the New York Rangers. </p>
            <p>Despite the icy temperatures inside, the players still had to wear their basketball jerseys and shorts.</p>
            <p>So the Knicks, who are used to sweating it out on the hardwood, ended up with goose bumps because of the chilly conditions.</p>
            <p>But when the open was completed and played on the MSG video screen, it was the fans who got goose bumps from the emotion of the piece, with its electrifying combination of music, game action, player images and New York scenics.</p>
            <p>It resulted in our third Telly of 2012, and the 15th overall for Manhattan Place Entertainment.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) recently shot on-camera segments with Chrissy Teigen and Allison Hagendorf, for MSG's "Summer Block Party Music Friday". The two "hotties" host MSG's music lineup every Friday night.</p>  
            <p>Chrissy is a Sports Illustrated supermodel who's appeared on the cover of many magazines, including Esquire, Glamour, and Cosmopolitan.</p>
            <p>Allison is a media personality who is the TV host of FUSE's Top 20 Countdown, and also hosts 'Cosmo For Guys' on Cosmo Radio.</p>
            <p>Together, the two introduce clips from some of the most popular musical artists, while sharing lighthearted tips for enjoying summer in New York, from beaches to barbecues to concerts.</p>
            <p>"In this case we not only shot and directed the wraparound segments, but got to use the outdoor space in our offices as well", said Steve Cohen, who is the President of Manhattan Place Entertainment. "I guess you could say we had the 'home court' advantage on this shoot.</p>
            <p>With that said, a bit of a makeover was required before we could shoot.</p>
            <p>The before and after photos (above) show how we tapped into our art direction capabilities and transformed the area from just a plain courtyard space into a festive and colorful party setting.</p>
            <p>We needed to acheive a look that visually conveyed the sensibility of an outdoor summer party in New York, and I think we successfully accomplished that."</p>
            <p>So feel free to drop in on our block party all summer long, every Friday night at 9 p.m. on MSG, or take a look at this video on our <a href="promos/block-party-music/video.html">website</a>.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) utilized the Action Camera Car system to shoot a live action "simulation" of the road course that will be driven by the worlds greatest race cars drivers in next years Formula 1 Grand Prix. The race will take place along the banks of the Hudson River in  the towns of Weehawken and West New York, NJ in the spring of 2013.</p>  
            <p>The promotional piece featured intense shots of the actual race course as well as breathtaking scenes of the New York skyline and Hudson River from the vantage point of the road course.</p>
            <p>The Action Car System is built on a Porsche Cayenne chassis and features a remote controlled crane that moves up down and swings 360 degrees around the vehicle... while the vehicle moves at high rates of speed!</p>
            <p>Amazingly the vehicle can easily run at 70 miles an hour and perfectly stabilize any camera shot at top speed.  It is ideal for shooting action sequences that require tracking other vehicles moving at high speed.</p>
            <p>"It's a pretty wild rig" said Steve Cohen who was the director on this project, "there are five people jammed inside a Porsche Cayenne all specializing in their one area.  In the front row there is the driver who is an expert in high speed chase driving. Next to him is the boom operator who controls the movement of the crane. In the back row there is the operator working the remote controls for the camera (tilt, pan and framing) and myself watching the monitor, and finally our camera assistant who is tucked away in the back hatch handling remote zoom and focus".</p>
            <p>"All of us simultaneously had to coordinate our individual efforts and work as a cohesive unit in order to successfully capture stellar imagery... while going at 70 miles an hour through the streets of Weehawken! The sum had to be greater than the individual parts in order for this to work, and in this case it was".</p>
            <p>As always, MPE is 'driven' to use the state of the art technology to help enhance the level of production quality and production value that we deliver.</p>

            <p>The spot was shot on the ARRI Alexa digital camera."Choosing the Alexa was a no brainer" said Cohen, "we wanted the most cinematic look available in a digital format and in my opinion there is no camera that does that better right now than the Alexa."</p>
            <p>In this compelling spot, Leary talks about losing a friend to pancreatic cancer, and urges viewers to join the fight against the deadly disease by visiting <a href="http://www.curepc.org/">curePC.org</a>. You can also view the PSA on our <a href="commercial/lustgarten-foundation-psa/video.html">website</a>.</p>
            <p>Cablevision's support of The Lustgarten Foundation ensures that 100 percent of every dollar donated to the Foundation goes directly to pancreatic cancer research. </p>

            <p>Manhattan place entertainment (MPE) recently got "Back on Track" with SPEED to execute a major production shoot this time involving the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p> 
            <p>Working on location in Mooresville, NC, MPE handled all aspects of the field production.</p>
            <p>Through careful planning and proper execution, we were able to successfully acquire a wide variety of visual elements, that in-turn, will be implemented in a multitude of ways into SPEED's season long coverage of the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
            <p>"The first step for us was designing and building a set that created an edgy and moody environment for the Truck Series drivers to appear in .  Once that was achieved, it was like "shooting fish in a barrel" said Steve Cohen.  "All that was left after that was for the drivers to come in and follow our lead so we could get cool shots of them on the set"  The set acted as the focal point for the two days of shooting with the 34 different drivers, but also served as the main environment for photographing various specialty shots including racing props, signage, and other SPEED branded elements for the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
            <p>Steve Cohen Executive Produced for MPE and acted as Director and Director of Photography on-site, leading a team of talented production designers, producers, camera and lighting technicians and other production support teams.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was in high gear with its recent production work for SPEED Channel.</p>
            <p>Over a period of 2 weeks, MPE took its cameras and crews all over Daytona Beach, acquiring various branded elements for SPEED's on-air look, culminating in a marathon day of shooting with 36 different drivers from the Sprint Cup Series prior to the Daytona 500.</p> 
            <p>SPEED utilized MPE's vast production capabilities and commissioned MPE to design and build four individual racing related sets where distinctive images of each of the drivers could then be captured.</p>

            <p>A rotation system was put into place so that each driver could be photographed in each of the (4) environments in a "timely" manner.   MPE was given the challenge of having a total of (5) minutes with all of the drivers at each set.  That's video productions version of a "pit-stop", but once again, MPE raced across the finish line with flying colors (this is our 12th year shooting NASCAR related imagery).</p>
