            <p>With the opening of minicamp earlier this week, The New York Jets held their annual media day at the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center in Florham Park, NJ.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the New York Jets, and Rooftop2 Productions, Manhattan Place Entertainment once again was given the opportunity to "get in the game" in terms of handling video production services for all (6) of the production set-ups.</p>

            <p>The material that was acquired will be utilized for creating a wide  variety of content  including the new season's scoreboard open, which will appear on the video projection screens inside Met Life Stadium prior to the kick-off of each of Gang Green's home games.</p>


            <p>Click on <a href="http://www.newyorkjets.com/photos/photo-gallery/Jets-Pose-for-Camera-on-Multimedia-Day/dfabdc8d-722a-4503-ad6c-d70c713cd3e0">here</a> to see some behind the scenes photos from the (6) different production environments that were created for the players to appear in, and get a sneak peak at what some of the imagery for this years video open will look like.</p>

            <p>In this promotional spot for "Avengers: Age of Ultron" check out how Ultron paid a little visit to ESPN, and terrorized the place!</p>

            <p>Soapbox Films in Los Angeles created the spot and "joined forces" with Manhattan Place Entertainment, utilizing MPE's "special powers" for handling field production.</p>

            <p>ESPN's Sara Walsh and Michael Smith appear in the spot, and Ultron makes a cameo as well!</p>


            <p>All of the shooting took place at ESPN's facilities in Bristol, CT.</p>

            <p>This series for CBS Sports, CBS NFL Today analyst and former head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers Bill Cowher, visits with, and lends coaching advice to Westwood High School's inspirational coach John Zisa. At the age of 18, Zisa had an accident in a swimming pool that nearly killed him, and left him paralyzed from the neck down. In 1989, after nearly 10 years of hospitalization and rehabilitation, Zisa's high school football coach, the man he played for at the time he met with his accident, convinced Zisa into becoming an assistant coach for him. Now more than 18 years later, Zisa is still on the sidelines and going strong, (Westwood has played for the State Championship 2 years in a row) proving that you can overcome life's biggest obstacles. As a coach and a man, he is an inspiration to all who know him. Charlie Bloom Produced the heartwarming feature for the CBS NFL Today. Steve Cohen shot and directed the piece.</p>

                  <p>New York Live In-Concert: Pilot is a new music series currently in production. The pilot episode, featuring a performance by the band Chvrches, took place in the middle of iconic Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The entire space was shut down in the wee hours of the morning for their performance.  Manhattan Place Entertainment provided production services for this project and worked closely with show co-host Kayla Riley in recording all of her on-camera segments. Interesting tidbit: The show was supposed to be shot on a Tuesday but was unexpectedly rescheduled for two days later. MPE helped the show producers City Drive to regroup and pull together the resources needed to be ready to shoot two days later. MPE has also shot segments with musical act Train for the series. Other featured musicians scheduled to appear are Foster The People, Demi Lovato and Coheed and Cambria.</p>

            <img class="float_right" src="images/recent-work/serving-court.jpeg" alt="The 2014 US Open: 'Serving the Court'"  />
            <p>"Let's face it, through no 'fault' of our own, the closest we're ever going to get to 'serving' at the US Open is from the sidelines... in a video production services capacity.  I guess you could say that our 'return of service' is more in the context of being asked back to cover the US Open for the 5th year running" says Steve Cohen, President of Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE). "In another bad tennis pun: we like to say that we are always working hard to improve the way we 'serve'.  It's also nice to have 'court dates', without the need for a lawyer." (Ugh!).</p>
            <p>The US Open is a huge event.  It's bigger than just the amazing tennis that is played on the courts of the National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows. New York City becomes a showcase for all of the marketing, advertising and promotional efforts that are connected to the sport of tennis through some of the worlds most well known brands.</p>
            <p>MPE has been in the middle of it all since the start of the 2014 Open working with the Tennis Channel and covering the US Open from both a Tennis content perspective (elements used on-air for Tennis Channel's coverage of the US Open) as well as providing content for marketing and promotional purposes as well (content created for, and used by the brands).</p>
            <p>This year we shot with big time players and big time brands including Roger Federer, Victoria Azarenka, and the Bryan brothers, and have canvased NYC shooting pieces for Esurance, Mercedes Benz, HEAD, Lacoste, Emirates Airlines, Wilson, the NASDAQ, the USTA and more.</p>
            <p>Serena Williams made history yesterday by three-peating at the U.S. Open and winning the Championship for the 6th time in her career.</p>
            <p>The "Jury" is still out on who will win the men's championship between Marin Cilic and Kei Nishikori, (today at 5pm est), but each man will have "their day in court" playing one another in a best of 5 that will ultimately determine the final "verdict" for this years tournament.</p>
            <p>"Serving at The US Open is something that we have loved doing for the past 5 years, so I guess it would be fair to say that we've had some 'racket' going!"</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment Shoots College Arm Wrestling Series - Airing on ESPN</p>
            <p>The newly established College Arm Wrestling League (C.A.W.L. to Arms), created by NYC Brand Productions, recently held it's first tournament at the Legendary Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ. 4 Coed teams comprised of feisty arm wrestlers from Syracuse University, Rutgers, Penn State and The University of Connecticut went nose to nose and elbow to elbow in their quest to win a $10,000.00 cash prize and more importantly... bragging rights for their respective schools.</p>
            <p>The 2 semi final matches and the championship match (3 separate specials) aired nationally on ESPNU, supporting the growing trend towards networks televising non-mainstream collegiate sports.</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was selected by Dutch Productions Executive Producer Steve DeGroot and C.A.W.L. to Arms creator NYC Brand Productions to execute the field production services for the series. "When shooting an event that is fairly new to TV, you know that there will inherently be surprises," said DeGroot. "We knew by bringing in Manhattan Place there would be no uncertainty with respect to the shooting, lighting, sound or any of the technical aspects of the production. It is extremely comforting knowing that when MPE is doing their thing, everything that needs to get handled is getting handled in the most professional way possible, and that it is all going to look fantastic. It alleviates the pressure on me and enables me to focus on other key areas that need my attention".</p>
            <p>"We covered this just like any other live multi-camera sports event would be covered, with one "little" twist: we set-up our cameras to shoot at 24 frames per second, which gave the images a more film like texture", said Steve Cohen who acted as the Director of Photography on the Arm Wrestling Series. "We wanted to "up" the overall production value for our client and by shooting it with the texture of a commercial/feature film as opposed to having the look of a "live" newscast, we were able to achieve a more polished and cinematic presentation".</p>
            <p>DeGroot added, "When we submitted the first cut of the show to ESPN to get their editorial feedback, the initial comments were all about how good the shots were and how beautiful the show "looked".  That's always a good place to start when you are getting client feedback. And that was a direct testament to the job that Manhattan Place Entertainment did. At the end of the day the matches were exciting, the students who participated were terrific, but I think it was the high end coverage that made the show great for ESPN".</p>
            <p>The matches will be re-airing this Saturday, July 5th on ESPN2. In a "CAWL to ARMS" we request that you check your local listings and tune in!</p>

            <img class="float_right" src="images/recent-work/belmont-1.jpg" alt="It's 'Post Time' for the Triple Crown at Belmont!"  />
            <p>There has not been a triple crown winner in horse racing since Affirmed last won it in 1978.  That's 36 years!  Now with post time nearly upon us, California Chrome has a chance to end that drought and make horse racing history if he can win the Belmont Stakes this Saturday, June 7th.</p>
            <p>"For the past three years, MPE has done an excellent job producing our Belmont Stakes commercials. We are particularly impressed with their 2014 efforts as they worked on a very accelerated timeline to highlight California Chrome's attempt at sweeping the Belmont Stakes.  From assisting in obtaining the footage, to the editing and trafficking process, MPE is extremely skilled and easy to work with.  Steve and Jamie's professionalism stands out and is one of the many reasons we return to them every year for our production of commercial spots. " Donald Nelson, NYRA Advertising Manager.</p>
            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/belmont-2.jpg" alt="It's 'Post Time' for the Triple Crown at Belmont!"  />
            <p>"I think you could say that we've built up a pretty solid track record with the NYRA (yes pun very much intended)," said Steve Cohen.</p>
            <p>We are very pleased that the NYRA has chosen us each of the past 3 years to produce and edit their spots. We have a tremendously talented post-production team, and in the Belmont scenario we are always faced with the challenge of producing and editing a high quality spot that needs to be completed very quickly.</p>
            <p>The results of the Preakness determine if there will be a triple crown bid or not. So essentially, we have 5 days from the conclusion of the Preakness to figure out the concept, edit the spot, mix it, go through approvals, and then electronically traffic the spot to get it on the air... with enough lead time to adequately and effectively promote the Belmont.</p>
            <p>On the field production side, MPE also produced and shot special visual elements of Belmont Park for FOX Sports 1 that will be used during "The Mike Francessa Show" for a Belmont Stakes broadcast that takes place live from the fabled venue on Friday June 6th.</p>

            <p>The New York Rangers have the city of New York buzzing over their first Stanley Cup finals appearance since their magical run in 1994.</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was there in 1994, and now 20 years later has once again been called upon by the MSG Creative Service Department to shoot On-air promotional spots promoting MSG Network's coverage of the Stanley Cup Final (beginning tonight on MSG Network).</p>
            <p>"I was field producing for "Oh Baby" (the Rangers '94 championship video) and was on the ice as the team celebrated winning the cup 20 years ago." said Steve Cohen, MPE's President (and lifelong Rangers fan). "It was one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating experiences of my career. Being around this team and feeling the buzz around this city is very reminiscent of the cup run of '94. Its hard not to get caught up in it!"</p>
            <p>The footage will be used to create on air promotional spots as well as teases, features, and bumps for the "Delta Rangers Stanley Cup Countdown" (airs on gamedays), the "Hyundai Rangers Stanley Cup Gamenight" (airs on gamedays), and the "Chase Rangers Stanley Cup Insider" (airs every day between games) on MSG Network.</p>

            <p>Choosing how to come on the air for any television broadcast is a big decision. When it's a Super Bowl, the decision becomes monumental.</p>
            <p>FOX Sports decided to create an "opening number" for this years Super Bowl that paid tribute to the great white way... Broadway. And like they've done on 7 previous Super Bowls, they turned to Manhattan Place Entertainment to make their show open, a show stopper!</p>
            <p>"Anytime you get an opportunity to work on something that is going to air during Super Bowl Sunday, you can't help but feel the magnitude" said Steve Cohen, the Director of Photography who shot the opening piece. "but this time it felt even bigger because the stage was literally and figuratively set in New York City".</p>
            <p>The casts of Kinky Boots, Rock of Ages, Newsies, Mamma Mia, Beautiful and Motown, performed a special Super Bowl rendition of the George M. Cohan classic "Give My Regards to Broadway" and did so from the hallowed stages they appear on every night.</p>
            <p>"It was really fun shooting in the different theaters and working with the different casts and crew members," added Cohen,"but there were a few challenges. In some cases we literally had only 20 minutes to get in, set-up, light, shoot the performers performing, breakdown and leave, because we were shooting right up until the time the theater opened it's doors for that nights performance. You might say there was a little pressure on us "to perform"."</p>
            <p>The piece led off The FOX NFL Sunday Super Bowl Pre-game show to an estimated viewership of more than 30 million people.</p>
            <p>It was created, produced, and choreographed by Bernie Kim of FOX Sports, and Manhattan Place Entertainment handled all of the field production services.</p>
            <p>Thankfully the piece got "rave" reviews ... from the most important critics of all, our client FOX Sports.</p>

The pilot incorporated mock “studio” game-show components, real time cooking challenges in an actual restaurant kitchen, and a soccer field sized obstacle course with 3 competitors racing against one another simultaneously. This reality style multi-camera shoot demanded run and gun speed and efficiency, along with the need for creating/establishing a signature cinematic look and style for the series.

Multiple wireless video village set-ups were provided, enabling the production team to have live viewing capabilities “on the fly”.</p>
            <p>The Pilot was shot in three locations in two days and had more than 15 set-ups.

            <p>St. Vincents Medical Center of Bridgeport, CT, has unveiled their latest branded campaign for print, web, and over the air commercials. The campaign entitled "Gentler Hands, Sharper Minds" focuses on the special care and medical expertise that St. Vincent's department of cardio vascular medicine provides for its patients.</p>
            <p>"This is the third year in a row that we have had the honor of working with St. Vincent's. It is always rewarding for MPE because we get to see first hand some of the great things that this institution is doing to help people with life threatening health issues", said Steve Cohen, President of Manhattan Place Entertainment.</p>
            <p>Paula Marker, Manager, Marketing Communications at St Vincent's Hospital added, "Shooting in a hospital is never easy and then add in that we were shooting in an Operating Room on an active Operating Room suite hallway and you can understand the constraints MPE had to work with. They took a difficult complex situation and made it look simple. The end product was perfect! I couldn't have asked for better"</p>
            <p>Director of photography Chris Bierlein commented "The approach for these spots was indeed to shoot in the actual hospital environment as opposed to on a soundstage. We used the real operating rooms and real doctors, nurses, and administrators as opposed to casting professional actors. By doing so, I think we were able to more effectively convey the sensibility of the hospital's messaging, in a very genuine way". Cohen added "Taking that approach can present some challenges. For instance, sometimes the operating room that you plan on shooting in, or a doctor that was scheduled to work with you, suddenly become unavailable because they are needed in cases of emergency. These are challenges that must be dealt with from a production standpoint, challenges that you have to expect and prepare for if you are going to choose to work in an environment and with the people from that environment that serve to help others every day. Challenging for us maybe, but it is easy to put things in perspective pretty quickly when you see what the hospital staff and medical staff are faced with every day".</p>
            <p>The campaign was created by Franklin Street, an advertising agency based out of Richmond Virginia that specializes in Healthcare Marketing and Advertising.</p>
            <p>The spots begin airing regionally in Connecticut on October 21st.</p>

            <p>Bad Grandpa Is Here. It's "truManhattan Place Entertainment recently collaborated with Director Barry Bross and ElevenO2 Creative, shooting integrated content for truTV for the release of the new film "Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa".</p>
            <p>The :30 spot features the cast from truTV's hit show "Impractical Jokers" and was shot in New York City at Madison Square Park.</p>
            <p>The Jokers are pretty busy guys and one of the biggest challenges was finding a spot near enough to where their offices were so that they could quickly get to location, shoot the spots, and return to work so they could resume their comedy writing.   Madison Square Park was the winner, which meant shooting outside in rapidly changing daylight.</p>
            <p>"We shot towards the end of the day, beginning in full sun, but soon after, we began losing light.  Shooting on the Canon C-300 was  great because we could keep pushing the iso which enabled us to keep the scene looking consistent regardless of the fact that it was getting pretty dark out.   People would walk by, see the guys and wonder how we were shooting when it was so dark.  Then they peeked at the video monitor and were amazed to see that the image we were capturing looked like daytime.  It was pretty cool" said Steve Cohen who was the director of photography. "So even when it was nearly dark out, you couldn't tell the difference between our exposure at 4pm and full sundown.  And we didn't have to use a single lighting fixture".</p>
            <p>This is the 3rd collaboration between Barry Bross, ElevenO2 Creative and Manhattan Place Entertainment.  The first was earlier this year on another integrated movie promotion for truTV for  "Kick-Ass 2", http://www.manhattanplace.tv/commercial/kickass2/video.html .  The two recently  joined forces again shooting Public Services Announcements with Ron Shirley from the hit truTV series Lizard Lick Towing.  Those PSA's will air at the end of the year.</p>

            <p>McCarver prepared a retrospective piece about his personal All-Star game recollections, drawing from memories of his childhood, his playing days,  and his years as a broadcaster... a metaphorical  "before and after" of his magnificent career.</p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was proud to be selected by FOX Sports to shoot this retrospective.  Bernie Kim produced, and the piece was shot on location with Tim McCarver in New York City two days before the game.</p>
            <p>Below is our version of the production "before and after".</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment had the honor of being selected by the Times Square Alliance to produce a feature piece documenting "The Power of Words" -- a short film that appeared on the Times Square screens last month.</p>
            <p>"The Power of Words" was created in tribute to Nelson Mandela and incorporated text taken from the South African leaders most inspirational writings in an artful display that was synchronized on screens across Times Square.</p>
            <p>"It was an amazing experience witnessing this powerful art piece in the heart of Times Square,"said Steve Cohen who directed for Manhattan Place. "And it was truly an honor and a privilege to meet and interview Mr. Mandela's Grandsons".</p>
            <p>"Midnight Moment: A Digital Gallery" is the largest coordinated effort in history by the sign operators in Times Square to display synchronized, cutting-edge creative content at the same time every day.  Each month, the program presents a new selection to be screened with scheduled appearances every day at exactly 11:57pm. The piece plays for 3 minutes and magically concludes at the moment of midnight.</p>

            <p>When World Wrestling Entertainment needs to think out of the box, they call Manhattan Place Entertainment- and this time was no different!
        If you have young ones in school, you know that most every classroom these days has an electronic "smartboard" in place of the old chalk and slate some of us are  more familiar with!</p>
            <p>But the folks at WWE needed to go retro for their Extreme Rules promo spot, and they knew exactly who to call!
        Among the most resourceful production companies you'll find, not only can MPE shoot , direct, produce and post produce your content, but they will find the perfect location to shoot in as well!</p>
            <p>In this case the MPE detectives uncovered Assumption school in Fairfield CT, still rocking erasers and the like, lending itself as the perfect setting for a flashback of WWE superstar Sheamus serving detention as"youthful schoolboy".  In the spot, young Sheamus is seen repeatedly writing the phrase "I will not be extreme" on the blackboard, building toward the climax of the spot (you have to watch to see what happens).  The end product was exactly what the WWE folks had in mind-
        The finished spot premiered during Wrestlemania on April 7th.</p>
            <p>So remember,  whether you're in the market for  "Cutting Edge " or your literally looking to go "Old School"   -
        Manhattan Place will "go to the extreme" for you as well.</p>

            <p>For the second year in a row, Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) had the good fortune of collaborating with The New York Racing Association on commercial spots for the Belmont Stakes. The :30 second and :15 second spots entitled "The Test of the Champion",  specifically focused on the 3rd jewel of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.</p>
            <p>New York's Belmont Park is the sight of this annual event and the commercials showcase the history, beauty and grandeur of the hallowed venue along with the excitement and thundering action that is witnessed during one of sports greatest spectacles.</p>
            <p>Donald Nelson from the NYRA said, "Just like the first time we worked with them, Manhattan Place did an outstanding job.  They not only beat deadlines but provided great creative direction and an exceptional end product that captured the excitement and enthusiasm of our signature event."</p>
            <p>"What people might not know is that we were also prepared to cut an entirely different spot based on the outcome of the Preakness Stakes", said MPE's President and Executive Producer Steve Cohen.</p> 
            <p>"If there was a horse making a bid for the Triple Crown at Belmont, we would've created a spot specifically with that storyline in mind.   But when Oxbow won the Preakness Stakes, and it was determined there would be no Triple Crown winner this year, we stayed in the direction of "The Test of The Champion" spots."</p>
            <p>"But then again,  that's why we love working in sports production, it's unpredictable, which keeps things interesting".</p>
            <p>The spots aired on NBC Sports.</p>

            <p>An experiential web video created to promote the release of Sony Pictures White House Down starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum. The video was shot on location at LA Live. Unsuspecting pedestrians were engaged to participate in an obstacle course challenge that required them to deliver a “top secret” brief case to the Presidential Limousine aka “The Beast” (the very same vehicle seen in the movie)  positioned at the end of the course. Racing against the clock, participants were met with obstacles along their route such as a full squad of dribbling basketball players, a marching band, a mob of groupies, and stacks of road cases that were strategically off-loaded in their path.  Steve Cohen directed.  The action was shot live to tape utilizing 9  manned cameras, and 6 POV cameras.  Wireless HD video signals were fed from all 9 cameras over a 1/4 of a mile back to the control room. Manhattan Place handled all logistical planning and pre-production for the video production, all of the field production and the entire post-production process. Special 3D graphic elements of Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum were composited which were fed to multiple screens in the LA Live venue during the event. Michael Alan Group created the concept and executed all of the event related details.</p>

            <p>With the exception of the 3.5 million dollar Super Bowl commercials these days, most of the time, we miss them ---- commercials, that is ---- we DVR, TiVo or Netflix our way right past them.  The solution for a brand to get its message across? Product placement!</p>
            <p>In a way, we've come full circle - in the old days Art Linkletter, Gary Moore and even Johnny Carson would hold up a product right within the body of the show and begin pitching-Product placement in its most basic form.</p>
            <p>In this, the "DVR" era, Product placement has become infinitely crucial to branding efforts - "Modern Family" does it, "Skyfall" does it, almost all forms of reality programming do it - and more and more of them, including some on that list, call on Manhattan Place Entertainment to execute the vision.</p>
            <p>One such recent  example was with Ford and its superior utility vehicle, the "Escape".</p>
            <a href="/digital/escape-to-nyc/video.php"><img class="float_left" src="_img/recent-work/glam-ford-02.jpg" alt="Glam-Ford Escape"  /></a>
            <p>Ford reached out to Glam.com to consider exposure within its popular webisodes with Lauren Messiah, an L.A. based stylist and fashion blogger.</p>
            <p>Seamless integration of the "Escape" was employed with MPE's unique field production and post-production skills to create a viewing experience that was informative to watch and equally effective for Ford's messaging - a double win for the viewer and the client, always MPE's ultimate goal.</p>
            <p>Working with Manhattan Place is always a joy, said Robert McConnell, the Director of Ad Solutions for Glam.com. The team is dedicated to turning out an excellent end product, making the planning and shooting process easy and seamless, and lastly providing excellent value."</p>
            <p>Worried about folks skipping your commercial? Ford had the same concerns until they used Product placement with Manhattan Place Entertainment-Let us do the same for you!</p>

            <p>This week MPE did a pro bono shoot for Prostate Cancer Awareness at the School of Visual Arts -- the event featured an appearance by a fairly well known relief pitcher -- Mariano Rivera.</p>
            <p>Rivera, in most eyes the greatest stopper in the history of the game, made the news with his statements regarding last years post season --"It was torture", Rivera said.  "At one time I was home and I said I have to go there and throw, I was calling the office and they said, "Well you cannot do that, you're not ready."</p>
            <p>Rivera was introduced while his entrance song "Enter Sandman" played in the background as it has for the fifteen years he has pitched for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He was inevitably asked about his health (he was out last year with a torn ACL he incurred while shagging flies) and said  "I have my pitching coach here so I can't lie", Rivera said. I feel great, I feel real good."</p>
            <p>Rivera was joined by the aforementioned pitching coach Larry Rothschild, former catcher John Flaherty and former Yankee great David Cone.</p>
            <p>The  event was held to raise funds and awareness for Prostate Cancer.</p>

            <p>Recently, Manhattan Place Entertainment was honored to have been chosen as the field production solution for a charity called "Donors Choose", a group that does wonderful things for folks in need on a nationwide basis and more importantly right here in our neighborhood- the South Bronx.</p>
            <p>At MS 223, teacher Bill Ohl spearheads the effort to solve a simple yet critical need for his students-the need for books.</p>
            <p>"The South Bronx is Ground Zero for childhood poverty", Ohl said. "There are 500,000 residents in the South Bronx, and not a single bookstore to be found -"Donors Choose" allows us to put good books into the hands of kids on a regular basis. 
</p>
            <p>MPE provided the field production as part of a collaboration with the lead production team from "Anatomy" - the video is shown <a href="https://vimeo.com/57555383">here</a></p>
            <p>The video was shown at a fund raising event earlier this month called the "100 Women in Hedge Funds' Gala" and helped raise over 1.4 million dollars for "Donors Choose".</p>
            <p>It is our hope that MPE's friends and clients review the link below and consider a donation to "Donor's Choose" - it is a remarkable effort endorsed by folks such as Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert, who says on the website "You know exactly who you're helping".</p>
            <p>The website presents real teachers, like  Bill Ohl, expressing real needs for real students.</p>
            <p><a href="www.donorschoose.org">www.donorschoose.org</a></p>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment Founder Steve Cohen  said " Like any business we enter into a project to cover our cost and hopefully make a profit-make money. On this project, we simply went in it to make a difference. If we were successful at that, we couldn't be prouder as a company".

            <img class="float_right" src="images/recent-work/stones1.jpg" alt="WWE and MPE collaborate on Rolling Stones promotional shoot!"  />
            <p>As most everyone knows by now, The Rolling Stones are playing a handful of concert dates to celebrate 50 years of the band being together.   What you may not realize is that the Stones would not have been able to recover their costs for this mini-tour unless they got "fiscally" creative.</p>
            <p>"Usually, when you do 100 shows or 130 shows, you kind of start to break even around 30." said Mick Jagger.  "If you only do 7 shows you're never going to break even."</p>
            <p>So, the idea of a doing a live pay per view concert was put into motion!  And with that in mind, a strong pay-per-view partner was needed. Enter WWE. WWE, the world's pre-eminent provider of pay-per-view programming, in partnership with the Dainty Group and Endemol (the tour's promoters), will be distributing and marketing the pay-per-view event entitled "One More Shot".</p>
            <p></p>
            <img class="float_left" src="images/recent-work/stones2.jpg" alt="WWE and MPE collaborate on Rolling Stones promotional shoot!"  />
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment had the great fortune of being asked by WWE to shoot a variety of material with members of the band to help promote the upcoming live pay per view.</p>
            <p>"I'm not going to lie, this was one of those times where I would have paid to be on this shoot."  said Steve Cohen who was the director of photography for Manhattan Place Entertainment.   "It was a once in a lifetime experience, and one I will never forget".  (Too bad Keith was home sick!)</p>
            <p>The live pay per view event entitled "One More Shot" is this Saturday, December 15th at 9pm.</p>

                <img class="float_right" src="images/recent-work/dance.jpg" alt="Dancing With WWE Superstars"  />
            <p>We never imagined that the WWE would ask us to be their dance partner... but we were wrong!</p>
            <p>Since it takes (2) to Tango, the WWE once again "turned" (yes, another dance pun) to Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) to shoot another in its series of character vignettes.</p>
            <p>The latest spot features Fandango, a new Superstar who is a "smooth" operator both in the ring and on the ballroom dance floor!</p>
            <p>To get this project accomplished, MPE had to perform some quick "steps" of our own to meet the challenges involved, one of which was finding an available location that visually conveyed the look and feel of a network "Ballroom Dance Show" in less than 24 hours.</p>
            <p>We came up with several options and the choice was made to shoot at Manhattan's elegant Highline Ballroom.</p>
            <p>With Steve Cohen as Director of Photography, MPE handled all of  the production management providing such production services as camera department, lighting, grip, sound, make-up, wardrobe, casting, locations, and all of the manpower for the project. It all resulted in a piece that visually had a cinematic quality along with all of the glitz, glamour, and characteristic style of a TV dancing show.</p>
            <p>With our quick and efficient work against a tight deadline, we once again proved that as a production company we can deliver at a high level, regardless of circumstance.  You might say this was a case where we were happy to "do the hustle" for our client.</p>
            <p>The spot aired November 12th as part of the USA Network's Monday Night Raw series.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment saddles up once again with the New York Racing Association as part of an ongoing campaign to promote thoroughbred racing in the state of New York.</p>
            <p>The NYRA turned to MPE to produce a spot that highlights the importance of horse racing and breeding to the state's overall economy.</p>
            <p>The campaign illustrates how New York's more than 300 breeding farms, employing about 35,000 workers, make up a vital part of the state's economy.</p>
            <p>The spot combines exciting racing highlights from Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, along with poignant imagery from New York's breeding farms.</p>
            <p>This spot crosses the finish line by emphasizing the central theme of the campaign, utilizing the branded slogan created by MPE for NYRA "The Racing Heart of New York."</p>
            <p>The campaign premiered during NBC'sports coverage of the 2012 Belmont Stakes and will continue to run throughout the year.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment has continued to tag team with World Wrestling Federation, which has turned to MPE to shoot a series of vignettes.</p>
            <p>The segments are airing as part of WWE's '"Monday Night Raw" television show on the USA Network.</p>
            <p>And in the latest installment, the partnership "rages" on, as we catch up with two WWE Superstars who are ordered to undergo anger management counseling.</p>
            <p>With Steve Cohen as the Director of Photography, MPE's cameras shot three different vignettes featuring Daniel Bryan and Kane.</p>
            <p>A pseudo-psychologist named Dr. Shelby tries to help them work through their anger issues, as the two Superstars examine the roots of their rage.</p>
            <p>Can these two share the ring without driving each other crazy?
WWE fans will soon learn the answers, as the vignettes helped set the stage for another big night for the WWE Universe.</p>
            <p>The videos can also be seen on the WWE's web site, and hopefully you'll have as much fun watching them as we did shooting them.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment is taking a trip uptown to a mysterious new 'haunt' on the Upper East Side.</p>  
            <p>It's "666 Park Avenue", a new show on ABC this fall, about an apartment building called 'The Drake" that might be possessed by supernatural forces.</p>
            <p>MPE was called upon to shoot behind the scenes footage and content about the show, which premieres Sunday, September 30th.
Taking our cameras on location to the scene of the series, we shot an interview with one of the stars, acclaimed singer and actress Vanessa Williams.</p>
            <p>She discusses her role on the show as Olivia Doran, the wife of the owner and landlord of the building.</p>
            <p>We also interviewed the show's costume designer for some insight into the cast's wardrobe, and shot footage of the show while it was in production, including the cast shooting their scenes, the costume area, and the crew at work.</p>
            <p>The footage will be used to promote the new series and give viewers an inside look at the people behind it.</p>
            <p>So look for MPE's work on the show's <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/666-park-avenue">web site</a>, and be sure and drop in at New York's most thrilling and chilling address: '666 Park Avenue', Sunday nights at 10 on ABC.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment steps into the ring with World Wrestling Entertainment, collaborating on a special feature for WWE's "Monday Night Raw".</p>  
            <p>Recently we headed to WWE headquarters in Stamford Connecticut, to shoot a humorous vignette promoting a match between two WWE superstars: David Otunga and World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus.</p>
            <p>The premise of the skit is a mock deposition, in which Otunga plays an attorney trying to ban Sheamus's most devastating weapon: the Brogue Kick, after he kicked Otunga's "client", fellow wrestler Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
            <p>Seamus is forced to defend himself and he immediately sets the tone.  
When asked if he "solemnly swears", he starts swearing at his opponent, only to be told it's not that kind of swearing.</p>
            <p>Things continue to get more heated, until Sheamus brings the deposition to a crashing halt, by delivering one of his brogue kicks right into the camera.</p>
            <p>Luckily we still have a few cameras left.</p>
            <p>It all makes for an entertaining video, which aired September 10th as part of the buildup to the match between two of the WWE's top wrestlers.</p>
            <p>You can still catch it online on the WWE's web site, and we're sure you'll get a "kick" out of it.</p>

            <p>With the 2012 U.S. Open in full "swing", Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) is teaming up with the Tennis Channel on its coverage of the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.</p>  
            <p>MPE has been called upon to collaborate on a U.S. Open show called "Tennis Channel Academy" hosted by a tennis Hall of Famer Tracy Austin.</p>
            <p>MPE's cameras captured in-depth interviews with some of the biggest stars in tennis, including three-time U.S. Open champion Serena Williams, five-time champ Roger Federer, Olympic gold medalist Andy Murray and career Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova.</p>
            <p>We also shot a feature on one of the most accomplished and inspirational players in tennis history, the late Arthur Ashe.</p>
            <p>Along with the player profiles, Manhattan Place is providing the visuals to establish much of the show's look, shooting branding scenics from around New York City, behind the scenes footage of the broadcast, on court action and the championship trophy itself.</p>
            <p>Tune in to The Tennis Channel throughout the rest of the USOpen tournament and you'll see some of MPE's best stuff "served" up.</p>

            <p>Ursula helped show the bloggers how Motions hair products can help African-American women wear natural hairstyles in various types, including curly, wavy, curly kinky, and kinky coiled.</p>
            <p>Three lucky contest winners received new hairstyles, as well as an all-expenses paid trip to New York City!</p>

            </a>
            <p>One of television's most respected journalists, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, will launch Season 2 of his daytime talk show this fall, "Anderson Live". Working in collaboration with Definition 6 and Joe Chapura's Danieli Entertainment, Steve Cohen was the Director for four spots focusing on the extensive preparation underway for this year's revamped edition of "Anderson Live".</p>  
            <p>The show will be moving to a new set at Manhattan's CBS Broadcast Center, and will have a live studio audience along with a rotating set of guest co-hosts.  The spots were shot in the various locations that were a "work" in progress, including the studio that the show will go live from, the administrative offices, and the set construction department.</p>
            <p>Shooting Anderson in these environments helped to convey the anticipation, excitement and energy surrounding the new show as it comes together. "This was a wonderful experience for me.  Working with Joe Chapura and Rich Krekian and the folks from Definition 6 on this project was a total pleasure," said Steve. "And Anderson is a real pro. As a director, I appreciate his instincts for knowing how to deliver on a project like this. He made me look good in the process."</p>
            <p>Look for the promos for the show over the coming weeks, and speaking of promos, we also want to "direct" your attention to the new season of "Anderson Live," premiering Monday, September 10th at 12 noon on Fox 5 in New York.</p>

            <p>The New York Racing Association (NYRA) was not "horsing" around when they retained Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) to produce their latest series of branded video content. The campaign included multiple commercial spots and a long form video for the web.</p>  
            <p>The objective was to show the excitement, grandeur and history of thoroughbred racing in the state of New York, while enticing fans to visit the state's three most fabled venues for "The Sport of Kings": Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga race tracks.</p>
            <p>The campaign also highlights the importance of the thoroughbred racing industry to the overall economy of New York State.</p>
            <p>"Our company needed two signature commercial spots and MPE delivered beyond all expectations." said Dan Silver NYRA's Director of Communications & Media Relations.  "The final product was of the highest quality.  Their professionalism and talent was evident in every step of the creative process."</p>
            <p>MPE created the new brand slogan, "The Racing Heart of New York"for the campaign and animated the NYRA logo to simulate a pumping heart beat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Silver added, "It was a pleasure to work with MPE. We would highly recommend them to anyone in search of a supremely talented and easy to deal with production team."</p>
            <p>The campaign premiered during NBC Sports' coverage of the 2012 Belmont Stakes.</p>
            <p>MPE is proud to have helped NYRA bring this winner across the finish line.</p>

            <p>By now, you've probably seen or heard the "DO EVERYTHING. DO ANYTHING.  DO AC." campaign, inviting visitors to come to Atlantic City.</p>  
            <p>What you may not have known is that Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) has been "Do-ing" its part on the video production side of the campaign.</p>
            <p>Euro RSCG Worldwide, the ad agency behind "DO EVERYTHING.  DO ANYTHING.  DO AC", along with the Atlantic City Alliance were faced with the task of capturing spectacular images of the special events that took place on the Atlantic City beach and boardwalk this past 4th of July. With an extremely high "visual" standard in mind, they once again turned to MPE.</p>
            <p>"Working with Steve Cohen and the crew at Manhattan Place Entertainment was a fantastic experience!" said Euro RSCG producer Lisa Christman.  "The footage looks amazing and both the agency and AC clients are thrilled with the final video."
</p>
            <p>"It was a pretty cool gig" said Steve Cohen of Manhattan Place Entertainment. "The main challenge was coming up with a plan that enabled us to be in multiple locations  "simultaneously" so that we wouldn't miss anything that was going on that day.  Having 6 camera crews helped!.  I think we got some very pretty looking images and I'm really proud of the way the video turned out".</p>
            <p>The day's events featured a free concert with recording star Kevin Rudolf, who performed his hit "Let It Rock", which is the theme song of the "DO EVERYTHING. DO ANYTHING. DO AC." campaign.</p>
            <p>The skies above the city also lit up with a fantastic fireworks display by the famed Grucci brothers, billed as the largest display in New Jersey.
After the sights and sounds of the music and fireworks, the night was topped off by the premiere of the dazzling "Duality" 3D light show.</p>
            <p>Visitors to Atlantic City can now experience the light show every night year round at the city's historic Boardwalk Hall. It leaves crowds in amazement, as the facade of the Hall seems to shatter and fall, only to magically reappear minutes later.</p>

            </a>
            <p>An international sporting event - at the Crossroads of the World, Times Square. And Manhattan Place Entertainment is there to bring it all to viewers, on the scene and on TV.</p>  
            <p>Global Media turned to MPE to bring its production expertise to 'The Grapple in the Apple", an Olympic qualifying wrestling match between the USA and Russia.</p>
            <p>The match was hosted by Beat The Streets, a non-profit organization that promotes the sport of amateur wrestling.</p>
            <p>It was the latest example of MPE using its complete production capabilities to successfully execute a project.  With Steve Cohen as Director, we set up an elaborate four-camera shoot, and handled all aspects of the live production on the technical end.</p>
            <p>The match was shown live on the Times Square Jumbotron in front of an estimated crowd of 20,000, and televised two weeks later on the NBC Sports Network.</p>
            <p>In the end, the United States thrilled the crowd with a 4-3 victory over the Russians, and Coleman Scott earned the final spot on the U.S. men's freestyle team for the London Olympics in August.</p>
            <p>But one of the biggest winners was Beat The Streets, as the event raised $1.4 million to help the organization expand and develop wrestling programs in the New York area.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment adds to its growing list of industry honors, with a 2012 Telly Award for its pregame introduction for the New York Knicks.</p>  
            <p>MPE was recognized with the Telly Awards' highest honor: a Silver, in the category of Best Sports Segments and Best Promotional Piece in Sports.</p>
            <p>We teamed up with the Knicks on the open that was played on the Madison Square Garden video screen before every home game at MSG.</p>
            <p>For this project, we shot specialized images of the Knicks players, headlined by their three stars; Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler.</p>
            <p>But the production was not without its share of challenges.</p>
            <p>Working with a professional sports franchise often dictates where, when and how a shoot can be carried out. And in this case, the only space available that would meet our needs and the productions design was the Zamboni garage used by the New York Rangers. </p>
            <p>Despite the icy temperatures inside, the players still had to wear their basketball jerseys and shorts.</p>
            <p>So the Knicks, who are used to sweating it out on the hardwood, ended up with goose bumps because of the chilly conditions.</p>
            <p>But when the open was completed and played on the MSG video screen, it was the fans who got goose bumps from the emotion of the piece, with its electrifying combination of music, game action, player images and New York scenics.</p>
            <p>It resulted in our third Telly of 2012, and the 15th overall for Manhattan Place Entertainment.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) recently shot on-camera segments with Chrissy Teigen and Allison Hagendorf, for MSG's "Summer Block Party Music Friday". The two "hotties" host MSG's music lineup every Friday night.</p>  
            <p>Chrissy is a Sports Illustrated supermodel who's appeared on the cover of many magazines, including Esquire, Glamour, and Cosmopolitan.</p>
            <p>Allison is a media personality who is the TV host of FUSE's Top 20 Countdown, and also hosts 'Cosmo For Guys' on Cosmo Radio.</p>
            <p>Together, the two introduce clips from some of the most popular musical artists, while sharing lighthearted tips for enjoying summer in New York, from beaches to barbecues to concerts.</p>
            <p>"In this case we not only shot and directed the wraparound segments, but got to use the outdoor space in our offices as well", said Steve Cohen, who is the President of Manhattan Place Entertainment. "I guess you could say we had the 'home court' advantage on this shoot.</p>
            <p>With that said, a bit of a makeover was required before we could shoot.</p>
            <p>The before and after photos (above) show how we tapped into our art direction capabilities and transformed the area from just a plain courtyard space into a festive and colorful party setting.</p>
            <p>We needed to acheive a look that visually conveyed the sensibility of an outdoor summer party in New York, and I think we successfully accomplished that."</p>
            <p>So feel free to drop in on our block party all summer long, every Friday night at 9 p.m. on MSG, or take a look at this video on our <a href="promos/block-party-music/video.php">website</a>.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment (MPE) utilized the Action Camera Car system to shoot a live action "simulation" of the road course that will be driven by the worlds greatest race cars drivers in next years Formula 1 Grand Prix. The race will take place along the banks of the Hudson River in  the towns of Weehawken and West New York, NJ in the spring of 2013.</p>  
            <p>The promotional piece featured intense shots of the actual race course as well as breathtaking scenes of the New York skyline and Hudson River from the vantage point of the road course.</p>
            <p>The Action Car System is built on a Porsche Cayenne chassis and features a remote controlled crane that moves up down and swings 360 degrees around the vehicle... while the vehicle moves at high rates of speed!</p>
            <p>Amazingly the vehicle can easily run at 70 miles an hour and perfectly stabilize any camera shot at top speed.  It is ideal for shooting action sequences that require tracking other vehicles moving at high speed.</p>
            <p>"It's a pretty wild rig" said Steve Cohen who was the director on this project, "there are five people jammed inside a Porsche Cayenne all specializing in their one area.  In the front row there is the driver who is an expert in high speed chase driving. Next to him is the boom operator who controls the movement of the crane. In the back row there is the operator working the remote controls for the camera (tilt, pan and framing) and myself watching the monitor, and finally our camera assistant who is tucked away in the back hatch handling remote zoom and focus".</p>
            <p>"All of us simultaneously had to coordinate our individual efforts and work as a cohesive unit in order to successfully capture stellar imagery... while going at 70 miles an hour through the streets of Weehawken! The sum had to be greater than the individual parts in order for this to work, and in this case it was".</p>
            <p>As always, MPE is 'driven' to use the state of the art technology to help enhance the level of production quality and production value that we deliver.</p>

            <p>As part of its continuing collaboration with Cablevision and The Lustgarten Foundation, Manhattan Place Entertainment produced a public service announcement for the curePC campaign to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer.</p>  
            <p>The new spot, featuring actor/comedian Denis Leary, was directed by Steve Cohen.</p>
            <p>The spot was shot on the ARRI Alexa digital camera."Choosing the Alexa was a no brainer" said Cohen, "we wanted the most cinematic look available in a digital format and in my opinion there is no camera that does that better right now than the Alexa."</p>
            <p>In this compelling spot, Leary talks about losing a friend to pancreatic cancer, and urges viewers to join the fight against the deadly disease by visiting <a href="http://www.curepc.org/">curePC.org</a>. You can also view the PSA on our <a href="commercial/lustgarten-foundation-psa/video.php">website</a>.</p>
            <p>Cablevision's support of The Lustgarten Foundation ensures that 100 percent of every dollar donated to the Foundation goes directly to pancreatic cancer research. </p>

            <p>MPE shot stylized elements with players from both teams that were used for a series of vignettes that ran on MSG during the postseason.</p>
            <p>The spots included close-up interviews with players talking about the passion, intensity, and tradition of the playoffs, and what it meant to them to be competing for the ultimate prize in their sport.</p>
            <p>The vignettes conveyed the message: "The playoffs on MSG. Its Different Here".  MPE's spots ran throughout the playoffs, on MSG.</p>

            <p>Manhattan place entertainment (MPE) recently got "Back on Track" with SPEED to execute a major production shoot this time involving the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p> 
            <p>Working on location in Mooresville, NC, MPE handled all aspects of the field production.</p>
            <p>Through careful planning and proper execution, we were able to successfully acquire a wide variety of visual elements, that in-turn, will be implemented in a multitude of ways into SPEED's season long coverage of the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
            <p>"The first step for us was designing and building a set that created an edgy and moody environment for the Truck Series drivers to appear in .  Once that was achieved, it was like "shooting fish in a barrel" said Steve Cohen.  "All that was left after that was for the drivers to come in and follow our lead so we could get cool shots of them on the set"  The set acted as the focal point for the two days of shooting with the 34 different drivers, but also served as the main environment for photographing various specialty shots including racing props, signage, and other SPEED branded elements for the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series.</p>
            <p>Steve Cohen Executive Produced for MPE and acted as Director and Director of Photography on-site, leading a team of talented production designers, producers, camera and lighting technicians and other production support teams.</p>

            <p>Manhattan Place Entertainment was in high gear with its recent production work for SPEED Channel.</p>
            <p>Over a period of 2 weeks, MPE took its cameras and crews all over Daytona Beach, acquiring various branded elements for SPEED's on-air look, culminating in a marathon day of shooting with 36 different drivers from the Sprint Cup Series prior to the Daytona 500.</p> 
            <p>SPEED utilized MPE's vast production capabilities and commissioned MPE to design and build four individual racing related sets where distinctive images of each of the drivers could then be captured.</p>
            <a>
                <img class="float_left" src="_img/recent-work/matt-kenseth.jpg" alt="Matt Kenseth"  />
            </a>
            <p>A rotation system was put into place so that each driver could be photographed in each of the (4) environments in a "timely" manner.   MPE was given the challenge of having a total of (5) minutes with all of the drivers at each set.  That's video productions version of a "pit-stop", but once again, MPE raced across the finish line with flying colors (this is our 12th year shooting NASCAR related imagery).</p>
            <p>Steve Cohen executive produced for MPE and acted as director and directory of photography on-site, leading a team of talented production designers, set builders, producers, camera and lighting technicians and other production support teams.</p>   
            <p>Between the branded elements, and driver portraits, the original footage shot by MPE will be used in a multitude of ways during SPEED's year-long NASCAR coverage, beginning with the Daytona 500.</p>
